3. **Invalid Address**: Double-check that you've entered your Ethereum address correctly.

4. **Faucet Issues**: If a faucet is not working, try another one from the list above.

5. **Transaction Pending**: Sometimes transactions can take a few minutes to process. Be patient and check your wallet again after a few minutes.

## How Much Sepolia ETH Do I Need?

For the Lottery DApp, you'll need:
